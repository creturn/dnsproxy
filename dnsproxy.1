.Nd DNS proxy
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm dnsproxy
.Op Fl dhV
.Op Fl c Ar file
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
The
.Nm
daemon waits for nameserver queries on a user specified
address, dispatches these queries to authoritative and recursive
nameservers and forwards the received answers back to the original
client.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Dfxfile
.It Fl c Ar file
Read configuration from file.
.It Fl d
Detach from current terminal and run as background process.
.It Fl h
Show usage.
.It Fl V 
Show version.
.El
.Pp
If a client from an internal IP address does a recursive lookup
the query is forwarded to a recursive DNS server.
Authoritative queries and queries coming from clients in
foreign networks are forwarded to an authoritative DNS server.
.Pp
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILE
.\" ------------------------------------------------------------------
At startup
.Nm
reads a configuration file specified via the -c option
or at the default location of /etc/dnsproxy.conf.

.Bl -ohang
.It authoritative Ar IP
Address of the authoritative nameserver [required].
.It recursive Ar IP
Address of the recursive nameserver [required].
.It listen Ar IP
Local address (defaults to 0.0.0.0).
.It port Ar number
Local port number (defaults to 53).
.It chroot Ar path
A path to chroot to before starting to answer queries.
.It user Ar name
A user to change to before starting to answer queries.
.It authoritative-timeout Ar seconds
Time in seconds when authoritative queries time out (defaults to 10).
.It recursive-timeout Ar seconds
Time in seconds when recursive queries time out (defaults to 90).
.It authoritative-port Ar number
Port number on authoritative nameserver (defaults to 53).
.It recursive-port Ar number
Port number on recursive nameserver (defaults to 53).
.It statistics Ar seconds
Period between output of statistics (defaults to 3600).
Use 0 to disable output of statistics completely.
.It internal Fa network
